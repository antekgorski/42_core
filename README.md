Libft
This project is designed to help you code a C library of common functions that you will be able to utilize in your future projects.

Project Description
In most 42 projects, we are not allowed to use any of the standard C library functions. Therefore, the objective of this initial project is to recreate some of these standard functions ourselves, along with some additional ones.

We are tasked with building a library that we will be able to use in our future projects.

Your Very First Own Library
Summary:
This project is about coding a C library. It will contain a multitude of general-purpose functions that your programs will depend on. C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful standard functions. This project is about understanding how these functions work, implementing them, and learning to use them. You will create your own library. It will be beneficial as you will use it in your upcoming C school assignments.
