<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Libft</strong>&nbsp;--&nbsp;<strong>Your Very First Own Library</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Project Description</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In most 42 projects, we are not allowed to use any of the standard C library functions. Therefore, the objective of this initial project is to recreate some of these standard functions ourselves, along with some additional ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We are tasked with building a library that we will be able to use in our future projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This project is about coding a C library. It will contain a multitude of general-purpose functions that your programs will depend on. C programming can be very tedious when one doesn&rsquo;t have access to the highly useful standard functions. This project is about understanding how these functions work, implementing them, and learning to use them. You will create your own library. It will be beneficial as you will use it in your upcoming C school assignments.</p>
